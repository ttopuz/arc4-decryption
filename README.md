# ARC4 Decryption

ARC4 Decryption was a school project (or assignment, I would say) I did during the Summer of 2019 while I was in a Digital Systems Design course. During this time, I was learning about FPGAs and this project was an application on ARC4 (which is a popular symmetric stream cipher, and was widely used in encrypting web traffic, wireless data) Decryption circuit.

The project's running on a De1-SoC board, synthesized using Quartus II 17.1.
